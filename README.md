# Challenge Project: 

## Credit-Card-Checker

In this *CodeCademy* challenge project I have to verify that the credit card numbers are correct. I will be provided with some matrices with the numbers to be verified.

## Project Objectives

To successfully complete this project, I have to make use of my knowledge in iterating the **arrays** through **loops** and the different *JavaScript* methods, as well as using `console.log` to verify the data, through the `Node` console.
